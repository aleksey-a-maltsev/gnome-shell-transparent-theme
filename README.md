# Gnome shell themes builder.
Based on [Gnome base theme](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/tree/master/data/theme).

## How to
* install dependencies:
    `npm i`
* download and prepare default theme (runs automatically during previous step but you can repeat that step if you need to):
    `npm prepare`
* build additional themes (you can find the result in `out` folder):
    `npm run build`
